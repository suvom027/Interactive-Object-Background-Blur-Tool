# Interactive-Object-Background-Blur-Tool
This project provides an interactive tool for selectively blurring the background of an object in an image. Users can employ a freehand selection tool to create a mask around the object of interest, enabling precise control over which areas remain in focus. The tool is implemented in MATLAB and is designed for simplicity and ease of use.
