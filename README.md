## Abstract
This project report documents the design and implementation of an Interactive Object Background Blur Tool using MATLAB, focusing on creating professional-looking photos through advanced image processing techniques. The system is designed to effectively blur backgrounds while maintaining sharp focus on selected subjects, significantly enhancing image composition and visual appeal. This report covers the architecture, design methodology, user interface development, and performance evaluation of the tool, providing a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in understanding or replicating this project.

## Introduction
As digital photography continues to evolve, there is a growing demand for tools that enhance image aesthetics through selective focus effects. This project aims to design and implement a MATLAB-based Background Blur Tool, which focuses on creating professional-looking photos with selectively blurred backgrounds. The system provides intuitive masking capabilities and customizable blur effects, showcasing practical applications of image processing techniques. By leveraging MATLAB's App Designer, users can intuitively interact with the tool, making it accessible for both novice and experienced photographers looking to enhance their images.

## Components
• **Computer**:  
A personal computer for developing and running the processor.

• **MATLAB Software**:  
The main development environment used for implementing the blur effects and building the App Designer.

## Project Workflow
*Step 1:* Load the Image
Use the "Browse" button in the interface to select the image you want to edit. This initial step sets up the image in the viewer for masking and background blur application.

**Step 2:** Create a Mask
The tool offers an intuitive freehand selection method to outline the object in focus. This mask ensures that the blur will be applied only to the background, leaving the selected area crisp and clear.

**Step 3:** Apply the Blur
Once masked, choose the desired blur intensity. The MATLAB algorithm processes the image, blurring only the background, creating a professional depth effect around the object in focus.

**Step 4:** Save and Share
After previewing the result, save the edited image using the "Save" button. The output retains the original quality, with the added enhancement of a polished background blur.

### Mask Creation
The masking tool allows users to precisely define areas that should remain in focus. The freehand selection provides flexibility in creating complex shapes around subjects.

#### Implementation
The tool uses MATLAB's image processing capabilities to create binary masks from user selections, enabling precise control over blur application.

#### Input and Output Analysis
Users can create masks of any complexity, with the ability to refine selections for optimal results. Below is a sample showing the masking process:
